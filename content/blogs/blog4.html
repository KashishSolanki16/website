<p>Born and brought up in Mumbai, India I am a 21 year old recent graduate currently reading for my Masters in Analytics and Management at the London Business School. I completed my schooling at Apeejay School in India and went on to study Economics and Statistics at St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai and completed my undergraduate study with a distinction and at the top of my class.</p>
<p>I believe I have always been ambitious, a quick-learner and passionate about building new and innovative products. Post my masters at the London Business School, I aspire to work at the intersection of consulting and tech and in the long run see myself as a successful woman entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Something that I would love to abide by all my life - Excellence &gt; Success.</p>
